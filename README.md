# Why I Created this Tool?

I created this tool to assess the overall performance of a chess player in a tournament.

# What is the Meaning of Average ACPLs?

The Average ACPL indicates the consistency of a player's performance in the games they play. For example, if a player plays 9 games in a tournament, their moves may vary in quality. Some moves may have a low Centipawn Loss (CPL) for good moves, while others may have a high CPL for bad moves (blunders, mistakes, inaccuracies). The average CPL for all the moves played in the tournament serves as a good indicator of the player's performance.

# What Is PGN file

A PGN (Portable Game Notation) file is a plain text file format commonly used to store and share chess game data. It includes information such as the moves played, game metadata, and optional annotations or comments.

# What Is A Centipawn?

A centipawn is a unit of measurement used in chess to evaluate the strategic aspects of a position and determine which player has an advantage. It is not a formal part of the game itself.

# What is Average Centipawn Loss (ACPL)?

Average Centipawn Loss (ACPL) measures the "value" a player loses by making incorrect moves during a chess game. It indicates the accuracy of a player's moves. Super grandmasters typically have an average loss between 10 and 20. Elite players use ACPL to assess the quality of their games. For example, GM Magnus Carlsen achieved a single-digit average ACPL in the 2018 World Chess Championship. Understanding ACPL is important for evaluating chess games.

# What Is The Benefit Of Using Centipawns?

Centipawns provide a standardized unit of measurement for evaluating positional advantages in chess. For instance, a one-pawn advantage is equivalent to 1 centipawn, while a one-rook advantage is equivalent to 5 centipawns (equivalent to five pawns). This allows for a more precise assessment of positional advantages in the game.
